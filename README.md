# Mini-Project2

## Project description

This project aims to answer key questions that reveal insights into the dynamics of Olympic success: Which country has participated in the most Olympics, and how do its Summer and Winter medal counts compare? How do medal distributions (gold, silver, bronze) differ between the top three countries in the Summer and Winter Olympics? Is there a relationship between the number of participations and the total medals won? Lastly, does the number of gold medals correlate with the total medal count? By addressing these questions, this project combines data analysis and visualization to uncover trends and highlight the factors contributing to Olympic dominance.

## Why this Project?

I want to take on this project because instead of working on multiple small projects, I want to practice writing a report based on a research question that I am asking. I want to practice scraping data from external sources, tidying the data, and visualizations along with the interpretation.
